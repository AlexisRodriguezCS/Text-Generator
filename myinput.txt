Sad song, I kinda hate the blues
But anyway
Strung along I didn't love you anymore
But anyway

I'd like to have a conversation
With my younger self and say, black wave

I'd like to have a conversation
With my younger self and say, black wave

I'd like to have the inclination
That I might float away, black wave

I'd like to have a conversation
With my younger self and say, black wave

Black wave

What's it mean?
I think you'd find it kinda
Hard to understand
Dark times are kinda funny
If you learn to laugh at the ride, yeah

I'd like to have a conversation
With my younger self and say, black wave

I'd like to have a conversation
With my younger self and say, black wave

I'd like to have the inclination
That I might float away, black wave

I'd like to have a conversation
With my younger self and say, black wave

Black wave

Black wave

Sometimes life it takes you by the hair
Pulls you down
Before you know it, it's gone and you're dead again
I've been in places and I won't pretend
Yeah I'd make it out just to fall on my head

Wake up strange and take the walk downstairs
Hit the pawn up on the corner and pay for my rent
You know that I could not believe my own truth
Just show them what I choose, got nothing to lose

Yeah yeah and it's O.K.
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight

You know those days when you want to just choose
To not get out of bed, you're lost in your head again
You play the game but you kind of cut
'Cause you're coming down hard and your joints are all stuck

I've tried to say that it's not the only way
I never knew if I could face myself to change
You were pacing, I was insecure
Slip and fall, I'm dodging calls, hug the prison I've been living in

Yeah yeah and it's O.K.
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight

Yeah yeah and it's O.K.
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison
Took a sip of something poison, poison

Yeah yeah and it's O.K.
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight

Yeah yeah and it's O.K.
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison
Took a sip of something poison, poison

Every time I turn my head
Lovers kissin' everywhere
Fingers runnin' down their thigh
They're just livin' the lie
Love is nothing but a Cowboy
Shootin' up one life at a time
I'm just trying to nurse this cold heart
This cold heart of mine

Keep my head high
I'll survive, 'cause

Every day, I put my Warpaint on
I'm a warrior, I find another one
Step aside, I'm moving through
All by myself, I don't need you
Warrior, I put my Warpaint on

People like to call me cynical
Pessimistic when it comes to love
I'm not lookin' for a fucking miracle
I'm just lookin' for a sweeter drug
Love is nothing but a Cowboy
Shootin' up one life at a time
I'm just trying to nurse this cold heart
This cold heart of mine

Keep my head high
I'll survive, 'cause

Every day, I put my Warpaint on
I'm a warrior, I find another one
Step aside, I'm moving through
All by myself, I don't need you
Warrior, I put my Warpaint on

'Cause now I don't need you
'Cause now I don't need you

Keep my head high
I'll survive 'cause

Every day, I put my Warpaint on
I'm a warrior, I find another one
Step aside, I'm moving through
All by myself, I don't need you
Warrior, I put my Warpaint on

Dried blood on your white vans

Staring at the stars for once over my phone
Think I fell in love and I don’t wanna go home
Without you
Tell me that you feel the same
We could stay here forever and never mention names
We could drink until the summer ends forget the pain
Just don’t leave me hanging that shit I couldn’t take yeah

How did you find me?
We got his password.
Hacked Sorrento's rig.
Z, I have something to tell you.
Not now. I've something to show you.
Then I'll get you out of there.
The Sixers found
the third challenge...
It's on planet Doom.
And there's more, they just put a
force field around Anorok's counsel.
I heard one of the guards
calling it the "Orb of Osuvox".
And the only way to
take it down is from the inside.
She is right.
Level 99 artifact.
Creates a magic resistant
impenetrable barrier.
No way through it.
OK listen. That's not
important right now...
what's important that we
get you out of the rig.
Alright, so, I'm looking
at a diagram of your rig.
If you reach up with your left
hand at 11 o'clock, there's some,
there's a panel above your head.
Yeah, I can feel it.
OK, there should be 2 release handles,
9 o'clock and 3 o'clock.
Can you feel them?
  Yeah, I got it.
  Pull them towards you.
OK. Inside the panel, there is a lever.
Grab it with your right hand...
and slide it to the left,
that should release you.
It worked! Worked!
I'm out.
LNT POD 41 F, you are on an
authorized break for 10 minutes.
41 F, you are on 10
minute break. Proceed to break area.
  Wade, you still there?
  Yeah. Yeah. I'm here. Where are you?
Where is Sorrento office?
It's in the IOI war room,
2 levels above where
you are now. But that's
not the way out.
What is his password?
  Wade, answer me.
  OK. It's B055man69.
But Arty, you need to go.
You need to raise the army.
An army?
Get to planet Doom
and wait for my signal.
What signal?
I'm going to tear down that shield.
Wait, Arty, wait.
You got to get out of there! Arty.
How much are they paying you?
Cause man, I got a lot of paper.
You know I can make you like a forest.
Hey. Shut up.
Okay.
This isn't real, you're tapping my feed.
Guys?
PASSWORD
BO55MAN69
F'Nale, they hacked my rig.
They are after the girl.
Meet me at Loyalty.
41 F, you have exceeded
your break time.
Report to security or your
coin count will be reset to zero.
So...
She just walks out of here.
How does that happen?
They are smart, they knew
what they were doing.
But we know they are
in Columbus and now...
Wait, you know what?
How do we know?
We have the model of the van...
  We spot them.
  "We spot them"?
That sounds like a great
encryption for our tombstones.
Why didn't you tell me this all here?
It wasn't relevant yet.
I need to know where they are.
We need to know! We need to find them.
They are kids, Nolan!
Man the hell up!
Do your job and I'll do mine...
unless you want to take this
and go after them yourself.
Find them!
The complete Nancy Drew.
Kegggle exercises remnant.
Bingo.
"Congratulations, you are the
proud owner of the Orb of Osuvox...
99's level magic artifact. Read these
instructions before deploying..."
"To turn on off".
Off, yes, off, yes.

Citizens of the OASIS:
I'm Parzival, first to the key.
I am here talking to all of you now because
our future is threatened.
For people who will not stop at nothing
to win this contest.
Some of you already know this.
You have lost much more than just
your avatars or your weapons.
Some have lost their freedom.
Some have lost their lives.
And now, this.
A force field around
the third challenge.
I only came here to escape the
shitty hand that life dealt with.
But I stayed, like many of you...
because I found something much
bigger than just myself.
I found a cause.
I found my friends
And yes, I know it
is kind of a groaner, but...
I found love.
And I don't wanna lose it to this
colossal douchebag named Nolan Sorrento.
This guy!
Back to work people!
He thinks that we're all too
distracted to even notice...
Nolan Sorrento thinks that
we won't put up a fight.
Sir! Sir! This is going out!
It's absolutely everywhere.
And now we're supposed
to hand him the OASIS?
This Parzival...
  Come on, come on!
  Yes sir.
  Left arm.
  Left arm.
He thinks that we won't
even put up a fight.
Well... I say he is wrong.
I say, tell that to the gunter
clans in the gold mines of Gygax.
Activate: The iron Giant.
Ask yourselves... Are you willing to zero out for the OASIS? Are you willing to fight?
I am Parzival of the HIGH five.
In the name of Art3mis and in the name of Hache. In the name of Daito and Sho.
We ask you to join us on planet Doom.
In the name of James Halliday himself...
Help us save the OASIS.
No no no!
No man is a failure who has friends.
Quadrant 4 team, armor up.
You are in the lead.

He was the first video game designer ever to hide his name...
  In fact it was...
  Try Adventure.
Play Adventure.
More than a minute and we're still alive.
This must be the right game.
Anil nathrach, ortha bhis is beatha, do chal danaimh.

How long does this last, this orb?

Anil nathrach, ortha bhis is beatha, do chal danaimh.

I ROk: I would say about 10 million years so... We should be fine.

Anil nathrach, ortha bhis is beatha, do chal danaimh.

Wade Owen Watts/Parzival: First to the key!!
Tracer, Chun Li, Deadties, Rayne, Lara Croft and Regina: First to the egg!!
Master Chief, Spartan Squadron, Covenant Elite and Covenant Arbiters: First to the egg!!
Blue Beetle, Batgirl, Spawn, Joker, He Man, Flash, Morbius, Aquaman and Robocop: First to the egg!!
Gremlin: Yeah!!!

Adventure.
What?
Oh come on!
The Sixers are at the final challenge in Atari 2600.
Are you in the sixer war room?
  No, you gotta get out of there.
  They're playing Adventure.
Adventure, of course.
Created by Warren Robinett...
he was the first to ever hide an 'Easter egg' in...
Look!
We are looking for a USPS truck.

Daito, we need you!
Daito, now!
Go to the bridge, go now! He's distracted.
Go go go!
I choose the Gundam form.
Z!
Arty!
Get to the castle!
Win the 3rd key before they do.
What is that?
You only got 30 seconds
before it's engine back.
Daito, abort! Abort!
You got 10 seconds!
First the egg!
Shit! It's her!
Arty!
Arty!
Z, we got to get to the castle.
She never left!
She is still here.
The girl is in the war room.
Sho, hang on!

No!
Arty, we have got this.
You need to log out!
If the game is Adventure, why haven't they won yet?
I don't know.
Arty, I'm serious.
Sorrento is crazy.
He will kill you.
What are you looking at?
There is nothing over there.
You are in trouble aren't you?
Samantha...
  You know I love you.
  Not the time, Z.
I can handle the challenge...
but I can't let you get
hurt in the real world.
Get out of IOI and
meet us at River South.
Wade, no.
You will forgive me for this, I promise.
Wait, no, no no!

Get up, Sixer.
Back to the beginning.
Let's go, move!
You are in.
Holy hand grenade!
How much did that cost?
Less than it's gonna cost them.
What is that?
Sir, the gunters are
approaching the challenge.
  I R0k?
  In position, sir.
Prepare my rig.
The ice is holding.
Still going.
Wait.
He's trying to win.
Yeah!
I won!
He lost.
Not Adventure.
Everyone who wins...loses.

It's not about winning...
it's about playing.
Remember Halliday's announcement.
The keys are invisible...
And they are hidden in a dark room, it's at the center of a maze.
Well, there is a secret in Adventure you don't find it by winning.
You find it by wandering around in a dark room.
Until you get to the invisible dot.
Pretty easy if you know what you're doing.
Really?
Let me finish it for you.
Your last chance, Wade.
Last chance.
Give me the key.
I give you 50 million in your account right now.
Why the hell would I ever do that?
Dude, that's the Catalyst!

Now, personally I wouldn't care. I just assume you'd never set foot in the OASIS again... no longer have to deal with any of this absurdity... but I know how important Halliday's competition is to you.
I will never let the future of the OASIS... rest in your hands, Nolan Sorrento.
Well that's fine. Three easy steps. One.
Wait, I thought that you were bluffing. Do you know that kills all of us. I have got 10 years worth of this shit inside of me.
  Last chance. Two.
  I will not go out like that. Like that's a camper move. You don't even know how to activate an orb.

Yeah, I felt those.
But this is my world, Sorrento. Hadoken!
  No no no!
  Step three.
No no no!

Get me out of this thing.

Guys?
Z! He's still alive!

Extra life?
Thanks, Curator.

Hold on!

Why feed in all OASIS channels?
Halliday wanted everyone to watch the end of the contest.
That's so Halliday!
  We tried Adventure.
  No, we try to win it.
But the hidden room is not at the end of the game.
You gotta go straight to the
invisible dot at the start.

Almost.

"Almost."

Sir, with all due respect,
are you sure this is our best option?

I mean, why can't we just correct

  the problem?
  Because my fuckin' nephew...

killed a dog.

And he stole a car.

A car...

which currently is among our inventory.

So we're giving everything up for a car?

It's not just a car.

It is John Wick's car.

Oh.

Sir, why don't we just give it back?

He killed my nephew.

My brother.

And a dozen of my men.

Over his car.

And a puppy.

And you... you think he will stop now?

Hmm?

Sir, he's one man.

Why don't we just eliminate him?

John Wick...

is a man of focus...

commitment...

and sheer fuckin' will.

He once killed three men in a bar  

With a pencil. I know.
I've heard the story.

With a fucking pencil!

Who the fuck can do that?

Well, I can assure you

that the stories you hear about this man,

if nothing else, has been watered down.

...Mr. Wick.

Hey, buddy.

Hey.

Good dog.

  What are you doing, John?
  Looking at you.

What are you doing?

I'm waiting for you.

Come here.

Hey, boy.

Nice peaceful place you got here.

  Hey, Aurelio.
  Hey.

John, what the hell?
I thought you loved this car.

What do you think?

Well, your motor's
about to fall out and...

the chassis' all bent up,

the   the driveshaft is all destroyed.

And I don't know if you noticed,
but you got a crack in your windshield.

I mean... what do I think?

I could fix this.

Thanks for finding her.

Not a problem, man.
I just made a few calls. No big deal.

Let me know when it's fixed.

All right. It'll be ready Christmas...

2030.

Ciao, John.

Santino.

Café?

Grazie.

Good to see you.

Good to see you.

I was sorry to hear about your wife, John.

Thank you.

Hi.

And the dog, does he have a name?

No.

Listen, John... with all sincerity...

I don't want to be here.

Please, don't.

I'm asking you not to do this.

I'm sorry.

No one gets out and comes back
without repercussions.

I do this with a heavy heart, John.

But remember, if not for what I did

on the night of your impossible task,

you wouldn't be here right now, like this.

This is because of me.

This, in part, is mine.

Take it back.

  "Take it back"?
  Take it back.

A marker is no small thing, John.

For a man to grant a marker to another,

is to bind a soul to a blood oath.

Find someone else.

Listen to me.

What is this? Hmm?

Do you remember? This is your blood.

You came to me. I helped you.

If you don't do this,

you know the consequences.

I'm not that guy anymore.

You are always that guy, John.

I can't help you.

I'm sorry.

Yes. You're right.

You can't.

But he can.

I'll see you soon, John.

You have a beautiful home, John.

Buenasera.

Well, good evenin', John.

Hey, Jimmy.

Gas leak?

Yeah, gas leak.

You workin' again?

I'll see you, Jimmy.

Come on, boy.

'Night, John.

Oh, shit.

I'd like to see the manager.

How good to see you again so soon,
Mr. Wick.

Shall I announce you?

Yes, please.

Stay.

Mr. Wick is on his way to see you, sir.

Impeccable.

Put these into circulation.

Where is he?

Thank you, my friend.

Beautiful work. Beautiful.

What are you doing, Jonathan?

He burned my house down.

You rejected his marker.
You're lucky he stopped there.

What the hell were you thinking,

giving a marker to a man
like Santino D'Antonio?

It was the only way I could get out.

Oh. You call this "out"?

What did you think was gonna happen?
Huh?

What did you expect? Huh?

Did you really think this day
was never going to come? Hmm?

What does he want you to do?

I didn't ask.

I just said no.

Two rules that cannot be broken, Jonathan.

No blood on Continental grounds,
and every marker must be honored.

Now while my judgment comes
in the form of excommunicado,

the High Table

demand a more severe outcome
if their traditions are refused.

I have no choice?

You dishonor the marker, you die.

You kill the holder of the marker,
you die.

You run, you die.

This is what you agreed to, Jonathan.

Do what the man asks.

Be free.

Then, if you want to go after him,
burn his house down, be my guest.

But until then...

Rules.

Exactly. Rules.

Without them, we'd live with the animals.

Do you board?

I'm sorry to say, sir,
but this facility does not.

I, however, would be willing to accept
the responsibility, should you wish.

Appreciate that.

Does he have a name, sir?

No.

Good dog.

Stay.

This was my father's collection.

I see little more
than just paint on canvas, of course.

But I do find myself here.

Please.

I didn't want to do this, John.

Had you stayed retired,
I would have respected it.

Look at you.

You're thinkin' about it, aren't you?

You're counting exits... guards...

Could you get to me in time?

How would you do it, I wonder?

That woman's pen?

His cane?

Maybe his glasses?

My hands.

Ah. How exciting.

Yet you know you cannot, can you?

I told you I needed that guy,

the way you are looking at me right now.

I needed the Boogeyman.

I needed John Wick.

Just... tell me what you want.

I want you to kill my sister.

Why?

There are 12 seats at the High Table.

Camorra, Mafia, and 'Ndrangheta.

The Chinese, the Russian.

When my father died...

he willed his seat to her.

She represents Camorra now.

And I can't help but wonder...

what I might accomplish in her stead.

You want me to kill... Gianna D'Antonio?

I could never do it.

She is my blood.

I still love her.

It can't be done.

She's in Rome for her coronation.

  You will take the catacombs in  
  It doesn't matter where she is.

That's why I need the ghost,
lo spettro, John Wick.

That's why I need you.

Do this for me,

and your marker is honored.

What say you?

Never one to waste words.

Fifty nine, zero, 3.5.

Jonathan!

Julius.

  Ciao.
  Nice to see you.

I fail to recall the last time
you were in Rome.

And here I'd heard

you had retired.

I had.

Then humor me with, uh...
but one question.

No.

All right, then.

One of our finest rooms.

Grazie.

Enjoy your stay.

Mr. Wick.

Is the sommelier in?

I have never known him not to be.

Good afternoon, Mr. Wick.

It's been a long time.

I'd like a tasting.

I am quite excited to show you something.

First...

Buongiorno, Signor Wick.

Ciao, Angelo.

Welcome back to Rome.

I am.

I know of your past fondness
for the German varietals,

but I can wholeheartedly endorse
the new breed of Austrians.

Glock .34 and .26.

This is the original map
of the D'Antonio estate.

Here, you have all the ancient ruins.

Tell me, Mr. Wick,
is this a formal event or a social affair?

  Social.
  And is this for day or evening?

I need one for day and one for night.

Recontoured grips.

Flared magwell for easier reloads.

And I know you'll appreciate
the custom porting.

What's next?

I need something robust. Precise.

"Robust. Precise."

This is the map of the temple
and catacombs underneath.

  In what style?
  Italian.

  How many buttons?
  Two.

  Trousers?
  Tapered.

How about the lining?

Tactical.

AR 15, 11.5 inch.

Compensated
with an ion bonded bolt carrier.

Trijicon accupoint
with one six magnification.

And this is the modern blueprint.

There are one, two, three gates.

Silicon carbide discs.
Ceramic matrices.

Accompanying laminates.

Cutting edge body armor.

We just sew it between the fabric
and the lining.

Zero penetration. However...

quite painful, I'm afraid.

Could you recommend anything
for the end of the night?

Something big, bold.

May I suggest the Benelli M4?

Custom bolt carrier release
and charging handle.

Textured grips,
should your hands get... wet.

An Italian classic.

Dessert?

Dessert.

The finest cutlery. All freshly stoned.

Well done.

  Could you do a rush order?
  I sure can.

Where would you like to have it sent?

The hotel.

Shall I have everything sent to your room?

  Yes. Thank you.
  Excellent.

Mr. Wick?

Do enjoy your party.

Good evening.

Are you enjoying the party?

Mr. Akoni.

Are you enjoying the festivities?

Please. Sit.

Ms. D'Antonio,

you can't just take
what is rightfully mine  

Nothing was taken.

Those among your own
came to us with these territories.

A knife was pressed to their throats.

Semantics.

Besides...

That blade you speak of was meant
for their children.

They were only meant to watch.

What is yours is now ours, Mr. Akoni.

Now go.

Enjoy the party.

Have some fun.

Sì, signora.

John.

Gianna.

There was a time not so long ago
in which I considered us as friends.

I still do.

Yet here you are.

What brought you back, John?

A marker.

Held by?

Your brother.

Tell me, John.

This marker...

Is it how you got out?

And what was her name,

this woman whose life has ended my own?

Helen.

"Helen."

This Helen...

was she worth the price
that you now seek to pay?

Now...

let me tell you what happens when I die.

Santino will lay claim
to my seat at the Table.

He will take New York.

And you... will have been the one
who gifted it to him.

What would your Helen
think about that, John?

What would your Helen think about you?

Hmm?

Why?

Because...

I lived my life my way.

And I'll die my way.

Do you fear damnation, John?

OFFICER:
This is Unit 14.

  I'm out by Old Lady Miller's house.
  Oh, shit.

I don't see anything
suspicious out here. Over.

DISPATCHER: Uh, ten four.
You want to go ahead and, uh,

show yourself code two,
officially cancel

request for assistance?

OFFICER:
Uh, affirmative. Over.

  Oh, shit.

  Sorry.
  Hi.

I didn't want to ring the
doorbell and wake up the kid.

  It's okay.
  Check it out. Fresh from my patch.

  Oh, my God.
  His eyes are hearts.

  I love it.
  Yeah.

  This is Tate.
  Hello. Hi, Tate.

  Hello. What's up?
  Hi. How are ya?

Do we have the whole house
to ourselves?

  Is that how this works?
  Yes.

  Sweet.
  Until Allyson and Cameron get here.

Okay, so, in the meantime,
you want to make some popcorn

and watch a spooky movie?

  Mm, no.
  All right, wait, check this out.

You're gonna like this.

I went...

  and got this tattoo.

Because tonight is the night,

the one we'll remember
for the rest of our lives.

What?

  What was that?
  What was what?

Did you hear something?

No. What was it?

I don't know. I thought...

I thought I heard, like,
a noise or something.

Yeah, it's probably just Julian
taking a dump.

Would you go look?

Do I have to?

Yeah, would you please go look?

Okay.

  It was weird.
  All right.

All right, little buddy.

  Oh, fuck me.
  I saw someone in the hallway,

standing outside my door.

  Oh.
  What's up, buddy?

There was a fucked up face,
watching me from the dark.

Ghosts and goblins,
little buddy?

Shut up, Dave!
I heard him breathing,

and then I saw him.
He's in here.

Boogeyman's in this house.

Okay. All right.
Come on, I got you.

  Let's check it out.
  Send Dave first.

  No, it's fine. It's fine.
  No, no. No, it's not.

  It's okay. Come on.
  No, it's not. No, it's not.

Come on, show me
where you saw Boogeyman.

  I'll protect you. I'm strong. I got you.
  No.

  No, Vicky, you go up there first.
  I'll fight him off.

  Come on. I promise.
  No.

  JULIAN: Can you call my mom?
  VICKY: Yeah.

If there's something
in the room, I'll call her.

He was standing right there
in in the door.

VICKY:
I'll check it out.

VICKY:
Excuse me, sir.

What are you doing in here?

Please, you need to leave.

Please leave.

Vicky?

VICKY:
Get out now!

  Gotcha.
  You fucking kidding me?

You're safe.

Nothing's in here.

  You sure?
  Mm hmm.

Y You check
behind the curtains?

I checked the whole place.

Sick.

VICKY: See? There's nothing
to be afraid of.

There's no Boogeyman in here.

What if it's a doll?

Ooh, it could be, like, one of
those weird, like, kid dolls,

one of those weird babies,
and they stare at you

  with those beady little eyes.

Oh, fuck, that was... Oh!

Ah, sharia.

Uh, c could you close
the closet door?

Yeah.

  Oh, shit!
 Oh, God.

No!

Oh!

Help! Dave!

Help me!

  JULIAN: Vicky!
  
  Whoa!

Julian, run!

  I'll go get help. Dave! Dave!
  Vicky?

  VICKY: Get out of here!

Don't go up there!
You're gonna get killed, Dave.

VICKY:
Somebody help me!

  Dave, help me!
  Vicky.

VICKY:
No, no, no, no, no, no.

No, no, no.

  No! No!

Fuck this.

DISPATCHER:
All units, we have reports

of a domestic disturbance
at 707 Meridian Avenue.

Please respond. Over.

Copy that, Dispatch.

MAN: Okay, guys,
don't forget to say thank you.

WOMAN: Come on.
That's enough. No, come on.

MAN: No, they can have
a little more, honey.

KIDS:
Trick or treat, smell my feet,

give me something good to eat.

Haddonfield
Sheriff's Department!

Responding
to a domestic disturbance!

I repeat.
This is Officer Hawkins.

Please respond.

  WOMAN: Honey, watch out!

Get out of here! Now!

Let's go, guys. Move.

LAURIE:
Get inside!

HAWKINS:
Fuck!

Michael!

Laurie. Fuck!

Jesus Christ, Frank!

  Fuck me!
  What the fuck?


What the hell
are you doing here?

Frank, he's here.

I know.

  This way, please.

  BARKER: Look who's up.

Where is he?

You tell me.

SARTAIN: The bus lost control
after Michael

overtook the first guard
and the driver.

He's no longer dormant.

He only knows
how to keep moving

and to keep killing.

And he will kill again
unless he's captured.

BARKER:
Come with me for a minute.

You sit still.

Well, I was
sitting still anyway.

  What do you mean?
  He's an asset.

He's not an asset.
He's a liability.

No, no. He's on this hunt.

Nobody knows Myers
better than he does.

  Oh, thank you.
  HAWKINS: You want me to take

this injured civilian
to go look for

  a psychopathic serial killer?
  LAURIE: Sheriff.

Frank. Wha What are we doing?

We don't need your help
right now, Laurie.

You're just standing here!
Please do something!

Excuse me, officers.

Laurie Strode.

BARKER: Laurie Strode,
meet Dr. Sartain.

SARTAIN:
I'm Michael's doctor.

Ranbir Sartain.

Oh, you're the new Loomis.

I read everything
about you and Michael.

Everything.

Did you know
our friend Hawkins here

was the first responding deputy

when Michael
was apprehended in 1978?

He stopped Loomis from
killing Michael that night.

Do you know
that I pray every night

that he would escape?

What the hell
do you do that for?

So I can kill him.

Well, that was a dumb thing
to pray for.

I'm sure he'll apologize.
He just needs to sleep it off.

Cameron doesn't want anyone
to see him as a bad guy,

but then he gets drunk
and gets belligerent

and looks like an idiot.

And then I look like
an idiot for vouching for him.

I'm really tired of everybody
letting me down all the time.

You deserve better.

I mean...

(SIGHS) Allyson, you're the
coolest, you're the prettiest,

and you're the nicest girl
in school.

And if anyone
doesn't appreciate that,

they're a crazy person.

Thank you.

That's very sweet.

Let's get out of here.

I know a shortcut.

HAWKINS:
From a clinical perspective,

Doctor, would you say
that Laurie Strode

has lost her fucking marbles?

There are many ways
for tragedy and violence

to change a victim.

They can grow accustomed
to always being afraid,

in constant fear.

They can grow weak,
they can grow strong.

But there's also
the other side.

What other side is that?

The effect on the victimizer.

You see, this is
what has intrigued me

through my studies.

How does a crime
like Michael's affect him?

Hmm? What's that feeling?

Is he on a random path,
or is he emotionally driven?

Triggered by something?

Perhaps some
unheard marching order

imprinted on his very being.

I want to know
what he's feeling.

I want to know what pleasure
he gets out of killing.

Where is this killer?
We gotta find him.

I'm not gonna stand in
the way of justice this time.

Remember,
he's property of the state.

  He mustn't be harmed.
  Oh, yeah?

We'll see about that.

It's not safe here.

Where's Allyson?

Where is she?

Where's Allyson?!

Honey, it's Mom.
Can you please call me back

the second that
you get this, please?

The police said that
they evacuated the dance,

and I can't get in touch
with you.

And they're making us go
to your grandmother's house

because it's safe...

Sweetheart,
this is your grandmother.

There is a police officer
waiting at your house

to bring you to us.

We're all gonna be together.

Now, do as I say.

  OSCAR: Oh, shit.

It's treacherous as hell here.

  Okay.
  You good?

  Take my hand.
  Okay.

  Right here.
  This is the dumbest shortcut ever.

Watch out
for all the poison ivy.

  Don't let me fall on that.
  All right. I got you.

  I got you. Okay, I got you.
  Okay, go.

  Oh!
  Okay.

You did it. Yay.

  Good job.

Yay.

What are you doing?

I mean, you deserve better.

  Right? I mean...
  No...

What the fuck?

I I... What? You're not
with Cameron anymore.

That does not...

That does not mean
I want to be with you.

I thought... I thought
you were sending me signals.

  Definitely no signals.
  I'm so sorry.

Please, you cannot
tell Cameron about this.

I I didn't feel anything,
either. I swear.

  I didn't... Wait, I didn't...
  You are so pathetic.

I'm going home. You can
figure your own shit out.

Sh... Who's there?
Wha What... Hey!

Motion sensor, dumb ass!

Allyson, I'm, like,

really drunk right now.
Seriously.

I got really horny
at the party, and, like,

all these girls were,
like, dancing on me.

Their beautiful bodies got me
all chubbed out, Allyson.

I... Allyson, please!

They, like...
they were feeding me guacamole

  in all these sexy ways.

It's not my...

Happy Halloween, Mr. Elrod.
I'm I'm just...

I don't know, man. I'm sorry.

I'm not trying to trespass
on your yard and shit, man.

I was just trying
to take a shortcut

with a really pretty girl,
and I just...

I just really like her, man,

and I I thought
that she liked me, too.

And I just... it just...

Have you ever
really liked a girl

and you just couldn't have her?

I'm s... I'm sorry, man.

I'll just... I'll peace out
of your hair, man.

Thank thank you for...

Hey, uh...

where'd you go, man?
You're acting...

Dude, you're acting, like,

really sketchy right now.
I don't...

Uh...

What's up?

I'm I'm I'm leaving right...
I don't...

I'm...

Ow! Oh, my God! Aah! Aah!

Help me! Help!

Please! Somebody!

Somebody, help me, please!

Somebody, please!
Please, somebody!

Somebody, please help me!
Please!

Please, somebody, help me! Aah!

  Aah! Anybody!
  Oscar, come on.

Please, dear God! Please!

Plea... Please!

Help me! Help me! Help me!

Please help me!

  Help! Let me in!

Let me in!

Help!

Somebody!

Help!

Help! Help!

Somebody!

Please!

Help!

KAREN: 'Cause my daughter
is not calling.

OFFICER FRANCIS:
It's safer for you...

  She's not texting.
  RAY: Come on, Karen, let's go inside.

FRANCIS: Everyone's looking
for your daughter.

  RAY: Let them take care of it.
  So whoever you had

looking for her is obviously
not able to identify her.

  We're gonna find your daughter.
  It's Halloween.

  We're gonna bring her here.
  There are kids everywhere.

  Karen, come on.
  There is no way.

  Karen. Karen.
  She had a costume, you know?

  We need to go in the house.
  We have everybody available...

  In the last 40 years, okay?

Honey, if you let 'em
do their job, they're gonna...

  Karen!

WOMAN: Just breathe.
And if you want, we can call...

Stay in the car, Doctor.

  You all right?
  Take deep breaths, sweetheart.

  He's... he's down the street.
  Okay.

  Okay.
  He's back. He killed my friend.

Everything's gonna be
all right. It's okay.

Take a deep breath.

We're gonna take you back
to your mom, okay?

I'm a doctor. Lock your doors.

Everybody, get back to your
houses now and lock your doors.

We're gonna take you
to your mom.

Don't worry about him.
Don't worry about him.

HAWKINS:
Back in your houses now!

SARTAIN:
You heard the officer.

  WOMAN: What is going on?
  HAWKINS: Back in your houses!

Lock your goddamn doors.

What's this?

It's my childhood.

Let's go.

All right, pick your poison.

I like a revolver.
They never jam.

This is accuracy
and stopping power.

This is tactical.

He waited for this night.

He's waited for me.

I've waited for him.

Come on, Michael.

Allyson, keep your eyes open.

  He is out there somewhere.
  (OVER RADIO): 601.

Suspect reported on 11th,
near Saint Park.

Copy that, Dispatch.

I got eyes.

Look! It's him!

  Here we go.

Brace yourselves.


SARTAIN:
Don't hit him!

  Watch out!
  SARTAIN: Michael!

Don't shoot him.

  Doctor, get back in the car.
  No!

You killed him. He's dead.

  Stand back.
  No.

I'm still gonna blow
this motherfucker's brains out.

SARTAIN: Get away.
Leave my patient alone.

HAWKINS: Get away
from the body. Stand back.

I'm not gonna say it again.
Step away from the suspect.

  Step a...

Fuck.

Help! Help!

Help!

So this is what it feels like.

ALLYSON:
Help!

  Make room for my patient.
  No!

No.

No!

These people want
to kill this man

for the crimes you observed.

The most important opportunity

to understand the mind
of evil, you see.

So, when he awakes,
we'll be ready.

Ready for what?

The reunion.

Michael's pursuit
of Laurie Strode

could be what keeps him alive.

I would suspect
the notion of being a predator

or the fear of becoming prey
keeps both of them alive.


OFFICER PHILLIPS:
You want a banh mi sandwich?

FRANCIS:
A what? What is that?

  A banh mi sandwich.
  What's a...

Wh What is that?
I don't even know what that is.

I love that about you, Francis.
You're so predictable.

You're like a PB and J
every day kind of guy.

FRANCIS:
Oh, here we go.

No, a banh mi sandwich.

Banh mi is essentially just

the Vietnamese version
of a French baguette.

  Mm hmm.
  And the term actually refers

to the bread and not so much
the contents therein.

  Mm.
  But your partner,

  the greatest partner in the world...
  Oh.

...made an arrangement
with the Vietnamese folks

  at the restaurant...
  Mm.

...and had them make you
your very own

peanut butter and jelly
banh mi sandwich.

That sounds disgusting.

I'm not gonna try that.
I brought my own food.

  I'm very happy with my...
  What did you bring?

You want to see what I brought?

Yeah, I do want to see
what you brought.

Why don't you look at this?

  Look at that.
  Oh.

  Fresh brownie.
  Okay.

Chocolaty homemade brownie.
I made that myself.

That's that's, like,
what a five year old would eat

if they could make
their own lunch.

SARTAIN: I worked
with Michael for years,

but I've never seen him
in an uncontrolled environment.

I've never heard him speak,
you see.

In spite of my encouragements,
he remains unresponsive.

But tonight,
so many possibilities exist.

He spoke to me.

  He spoke to you?
  Yeah.

Um, uh,
when he murdered my friend,

he saw me,
and and he spoke to me.

What did he say?

  One word.
  What?

Let me go, and I will tell you
what he said.

You must tell me.
I must know. You must tell me.

Let me go, and I'll tell you
what he said.

Just stop the car,
and I'll tell you what he said.

What is that?

PHILLIPS:
That's weird, right?

Is that Hawkins?

I don't know.

What was the word?

Was it the sister's name?

Judith?

  What was the word?
  Fuck.

Michael.

606 to 601.

Hawkins.

Answer the fucking radio,
burnout.

  (OVER RADIO): Hawkins?

PHILLIPS (OVER RADIO):
606, 601.

Hawkins, please respond.

Hawkins.

  Let's go check it out.
  All right.

Say something.

Can you see him?

Hawkins, please respond.

Hawkins, please respond.

Let's go and check it out.

All right.

Dispatch, be advised,
we got a man down.

He's ten seven.

No sign of 601.

Karen, the lights.

KAREN:
What are you doing?

I thought you said
we were safer here.

You never wanted to listen
when I spoke of that night.

And this is why.

I've been preparing for this
for a long time.

You want him to come here.

I'm so sorry, Karen.
I'm so sorry, baby.

Any word?

Hey, any word on Allyson?

Hey.

Guys.

Wha...?

Ray!

Karen!

Where's Ray?

Michael's here. Get downstairs.

Go, baby, go!

Mom!

Mom!

I was wrong to raise you
the way I did,

but at least I can protect you.

  Nothing will happen to you.

I know you thought
this was my cage.

I'm scared.

I have to finish this.

Mom.

I love you.

I love you, baby.

Come out, Michael.

Mom.

Grandmother?

ALLYSON:
Grandmother?

Baby.

Mom.

He's coming. Come on.

  Shh. Come on. Come on.
  Where's Grandmother?

I couldn't...
I couldn't find you guys.

  Where is everybody?
  It's okay. It's okay.

  It's gonna be okay.
  I'm locked in a cage.

It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

Everything's going to be okay.

Mom, I'm so sorry.

I tried to stop him
from coming here.

  Okay. Okay.

Stay back.

Get back! Get back, get back.

Oh, God.


(GASPING, WHIMPERING):
Stay back.

Mom?

Help us!

I can't do it.

I'm sorry. I can't do it.

Gotcha.


  Happy Halloween, Michael.

Come on, Allyson!

  Come on, Allyson!
  Allyson, go!

Allyson, come on!

Go!

Karen, come on, baby.
Come on!

Oh, God!

I got you!

Allyson, run!

Go! Go now!

LAURIE:
Come on, kick him!

  KAREN: Allyson! Allyson, go!
  LAURIE: Go!


KAREN:
Now go!

Okay. It's not a cage, baby.


It's a trap.

Good bye, Michael.


KAREN:
Oh, God, someone's coming.

Someone's coming.


  Hold her.
  I got her.

I got her. Go!

Go, baby, go!

Hey!

Help us.

Well, if I needed a 30-second
lesson on how to drift...

All right, look, man, there's lots
of ways you can do this, all right?

Hand braking
is the easiest,

so the first thing
I want you to do,

I want you
to rip that e-brake.

All right,
after you rip the e-brake,

then I want you
to power over.

You know what?

Just don't mess up Mona,
all right?

All right.

Ready.

Set.

Go!

I told you.

Damn it!

Damn it!

Don't leave town.

Do you know
what time it is?

I thought
it was around 7:00.

You know,
US is a few hours behind.

Looks like the party
was better here, anyway.

Have you been racing, Sean?

You're out of here.

Go ahead.

You don't get it,
do you?

You have
nowhere else to go.

If it doesn't
work out here,

you're going to jail.
Do you get that?

This isn't a game.

And I'm gonna tell you
one more time,

if you're gonna
live under my roof,

you're gonna go by
my rules or get out.

Understand?

Understand?

Yes, sir.

Get in.

I'll get you your money.

Why you talking
like you have a choice?

There's a guy in there
with a paw

that owes me some money.

A paw?

Go get me my money.

Okay.

Han said,

okane.

Han said, okane.

Let's go.

You're in the pickup
and delivery business now.

I might call you once a week
or once an hour.

I don't care
if you're sick as a dog

or in bed with Beyonc?.

I call, you show.

Only if you teach me
how to drift.

This ain't a negotiation.

I wasn't negotiating.

What's he doing here?

He's paying me back for
that crumpled beer can

sitting in my garage.

Hope
he's not driving.

Gaijin.

When is your next race?

I'd really like to be there.

Why not be in it?

You heard me.

Ready to lose
another car, Han?

I'm ready to take that
'86 Corolla off your hands.

All right.

Put up the '72 Skyline.

Done.

What do you think,
Morimoto, huh?

Get him out of here.

We have business
to discuss.

Your shipment's late.

Since when are you
so worried about the details?

When is
the shipment arriving, Han?

Just sit pretty
and let me handle it.

Hey, Dad, it's me.

Uh, I had to
stay after school

for some
extracurricular activities.

So I'll be home
a little later.

Sir.

You really need to stop
following me around.

What are you
doing here?

I thought I'd stop by
and ask your boyfriend

for some drifting lessons.

Trust me.

You don't wanna be
a part of this world.

It's good enough for you.

You don't know
anything about me.

Well, why don't you
think I know?

'Cause I'm a gaijin?
An outsider?

Let me guess.

You're an army brat
who moved around a lot.

Your mama and daddy
was never home.

So you walked around
pissed off all the time.

And now you found your family
with these drift nuts.

Zero for one, cowboy.

Why can't you go find
a nice Japanese girl

like the rest of
the white guys around here?

Mamacita, oh my God,
I think your on fire

Do you want me
to get you water

Is everything okay
back there?

I can handle DK.

I thought he's yakuza.

His uncle's yakuza.

He's just playing gangster
in his little storage room.

But I need him.

He keeps Uncle Kamata
from poking around too much.

What do you mean?

Well, his uncle gets
a piece of the action

from everyone
on his turf.

We're on his turf.

50% of something
is better than

100% of nothing.

So have you raced DK?

Why not? Is he that good?

What's the point
of a race?

To see if I'm better
than the other guy.

Just proves you're faster,
that's all.

If I were to race,
it would have to be

for something important.

Or why else do it at all?

Why are you
letting me race?

'Cause you're
DK's kryptonite.

And you owe me a car.

She wanna break it down, break it
down, break it down, break it down

She want some reggaeton,
reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton

She wanna break it down, break it
down, break it down, break it down

She want some reggaeton,
reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton

Oh, shit.

I make ya smile right

What the...

Police cars here are
only factory-tuned.

You can do
better than 180 k,

they can't catch you,
so they don't even try.

'Cause its just nice you lookin
different sayin' to yourself

You know what?

I'm beginning to like
this country already.

When my chain keep linkin'
like Christmas lights

Mamacita, oh my God

Do you want me

He's underage.

Country boys and them boys

Ladies, ladies, ladies.

Disneyland

All these girls, man,
they look like...

What, models?

Check it out.

See,
Tokyo is the fashion capital

on this side of the planet,
all right?

Now, imagine
you been posing all day.

I mean,
that's a lot of hard work.

Not only do you get tired,
but, on top of that,

you wanna have a little fun,
but you can't

'cause you don't even know
nobody in town.

And most of
the guys around here are

too chicken shit
to even try picking up one.

So what do you do?

Man, you talk to the little
dude who makes you laugh.

Yeah.

Look, man, I don't just think
outside the box.

I tear it up.

That's my thing.

Yo.

You should
slow it down papi

You sound like
a carbon copy

Sean!

But you're
just plain sloppy

Hey Mami, you sexy

It's dipset Bitch

Baby don't stop now

Okay,

Top down
and I'm at it again

It's hot now
and I'm at it to win

You heard me

Who want it with me

Nobody wanna it with me
Oh, I'm so fly

Oh, Mami, Back up

Move it till you feel
something hard on your back

The red Evo's yours.

I ain't kiddin' I'm with it

Here it go, go

So, girl,

There it go
Yeah, just like that

What do you mean?

You're representing
me now.

What you think, I'm gonna
let you roll in a Hyundai?

So, girl,
let me see you get low

Oh, man.

Damn it.

My mother,
she's blind in one eye

and she can drift
better than that.

Han,
where did you find this guy?

Will someone please teach
this guy how to drift?

Is that yours?

Sure is.

What happened?

I don't know. I found
it this way at the base.

It's got potential.

Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

You know, Sean,
the Japanese have a saying.

"The nail that sticks out
gets hammered."

You're gonna be late.

Sean!

Come on, man, you broke it.

Hey, whoa, whoa.

There must be
a misunderstanding.

Out of my way,
or you're next.

Take it easy.

Look, man, I don't
do refunds, all right?

Okay, let's go, then!
Let's go!

Touch me again...

Here.

Try not to break
this one.

Say, man!

What the hell is
wrong with you, huh?

Now everybody's gonna want
exchanges around here.

Damn!

Not easy saving the day,
is it?

Maybe you could give me
some pointers sometime.

You're doing
all right.

Thanks.

Hey.

Yeah?

Sorry about the other night.

Your life isn't
any of my business.

It's okay.

Foul!

Ain't no damn foul.
That was a foul.

Yo, you in my face.
That was a foul.

Hey, Han,
sort this wanker out.

A wanker?

What do I look like,
a zebra?

So, how did you end up
over here, anyway?

Well, you know
those old Westerns

where the cowboys
make a run for the border?

This is my Mexico.

Why'd you let me
race with your car?

You knew
I was gonna wreck it.

Why not?

'Cause it's a lot of money.

I have money.

It's trust and character
I need around me.

You know, who you
choose to be around you

lets you know
who you are.

And one car in exchange
for knowing

what a man's made of,

that's a price
I can live with.

Look at all those
people down there.

They follow the rules,
for what?

They're letting
fear lead them.

What happens if they don't?

Life's simple.

You make choices
and you don't look back.

So,
if you don't drift to win,

what do you drift for?

You really
want to know?

Yeah.

Okay. Let's go.

There's no "wax on,
wax off" with drifting.

Learn by doin' it.

The first drifters
invented drifting

out here in the mountains
by feeling it.

So feel it.

Again!

What's in this bag?

You'll see.

How much you got?

Keep going, keep going.

I'm so good, man, I could
sell rubbers to a monk.

Again.

Again.

Watch it. Watch it.
Not too early, now.

Go, go, go, go!

Don't lose it! Don't lose it!

Hey, Han.

Hey, Twink.
Get this man a bunk.

Pleasure doing business.

Yeah, baby. I told you.
I told you, didn't I?

It's actually not bad.

I didn't even have
to put ketchup on it.

See,
I'm not a total gaijin.

I hate that word.

It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.

I thought
you were born here.

Well, "outsider" can mean
many different things.

My mom died when I was 10.

She came out here
from Australia

when she
finished high school.

And all I know
about her is that

she went to work
in a hostess bar.

DK's grandmother took me in.

Well, my parents
split up when I was three.

Me and Mom
moved around a lot.

Mostly 'cause of me.

Well,
it was all 'cause of me.

Kind of made myself
an outsider, you know,

without even
thinking about it.

But I realize now,

outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

All that matters is knowing
what you really want

and going after it.

We used to come up here
when we were kids.

Even before we could drive
we'd cut class, sneak out,

come up here, and watch
the older kids drift.

Things were different
back then.

Once I got my license,
I practically lived up here.

Back then, kids just drove
whatever they had.

You know, we just made do.

No one bothered us.

The day I got my license

is the day I got
my first speeding ticket.

The day after that,
I won my first race.

I beat this rich kid
by three lengths.

I gotta admit, it felt good.

It felt like...

Like everything else
just disappears.

No past and no future.

No problems.

Just the moment.

Boy needs to chill.

Hey, Twink,
I'm gonna grab another set.

Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Another set?

No. Look, that was
your third set today.

I mean,
them tires ain't cheap.

DK, grab a chair.

We're about to
roast some marshmallows.

Yo, come on, man, look...

Stay away from her,

or the only thing you'll
be driving is a wheelchair.

Find yourself a new driver.

I'm all right.

What'd you expect?

You didn't just
play with fire,

you soaked
the matches in gasoline.

It's over.

All this over a gaijin?

I am a gaijin.

You've changed, DK.

You say I've changed.

But we're not so different,
you and I.

We're both products
of fuckups, aren't we?

They say your mom
was the best trick

in all of Kabukicho
back in the day.

Leave my mother
out of this.

If we hadn't taken you in,
you'd be just like her,

doing anything
for a buck.

Think anyone would take
a second look at you

if it wasn't
for your uncle?

We're the same, Neela.

Difference is I know who I am
and where I belong.

Do you know
who you are?

Do you know
where you belong?

Hey.

Come on.

Hey, brother.

I vouched for you!

Put my reputation
on the line for you!

We were partners!

You think you can keep
your side deals from me?

Come on.
We ain't in the Boy Scouts.

This is what we do.

Takashi!

What about now? Hmm?

Is this what we do?

Man, you need me.

You'd still be
shaking down teahouses

for chump change
if it wasn't for me.

Get in!

Go! Go! Go!

Come on.

Sean. Sean!

Takashi.

I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

Okay.

I'll go with you.

Neela.

See you when
Daddy's not around.

I'm putting you
on a plane tonight.

Dad...

Sean, don't argue with me.

I did this.
I can't run away.

I can't.

Sean,
I'm your father.

I'm responsible
for your well-being.

And I'm responsible
for my mess.

I gotta do this.

Can you understand that?

At least you're not
redoing my mistakes.

You all right, man?

We're leaving town.

Look, I know some people...

I can't do it, Twink.

Look, DK wants your head.

All right?

And the trouble you
just made for Kamata?

You're done here, bro.

Maybe I should
talk to Kamata.

What?

DK answers to him.

I know I just
didn't hear that.

I gotta end this.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

What, are you crazy, huh?

Han is dead, all right!

Plus, you can't just walk
into Kamata's place, man!

It's all I got.

Something I think Han
would've wanted you to have.

What's this?

You're gonna need it
if you're gonna make it

out of Kamata's place
alive.

Don't you need it?

No, it's cool.
Look, I'll figure it out.

Sean.

You need to leave.

You came to the wrong place.

I didn't come here
to see you.

Takashi.

You think

you can walk in here,
dump some cash and walk out?

I know I'm only returning
what belonged to you

in the first place, sir.

But that's not
why I really came.

I came here
to apologize.

I know your nephew and I have
embarrassed ourselves badly.

Sir, I'm here to offer you
a peaceful solution.

How do you plan
to accomplish that?

A race.

DK and I have caused
nothing but problems for you,

for us.

And I'm asking you
to allow us to settle this,

once and for all.

We race

and the loser leaves town
for good.

I've already beat
this piece of shit once!

Good.

Then it should be easy.

The cops
took all the cars.

Hey!

That's why she's spitting.

We almost there, Twink.

Couple more tweaks.

It's not the car
I'm worried about, man.

DK picked this road
for a reason.

This is his mountain.

He's the only one to ever
make it to the bottom.

Yeah!

Yeah!

Yes!

Come on.

Yeah! Come on!

Come on, Sean.

Let's go! Let's go!

Sean, you the boss. Let's go.

Damn! Come on, man!
That ain't right.

Yeah, baby!

That's what
I'm talking about, man.

I told you!

I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo

If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go

Fast and furious

Tick, Tick, Tick

Fast and furious

Tick, Tick, Tick

Hey, yo, Sean!
Yo, Sean!

Hey, check this out, man.

This dude over here
wanna race the new DK.

Heard he's been beating
everybody around Asia, too.

Not tonight, Twinkie.

Said he knew Han.

Said Han was family.

All right.

Let's race.

Nice ride.

I won it from my friend Han,
a few years ago.

I didn't know he was
into American muscle.

He was when
he was rolling with me.

You know this ain't
no 10-second race.

I got nothing but time.
