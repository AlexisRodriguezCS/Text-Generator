In the myinput.txt file, I've included some of my favorite songs at the moment, along with some of the movies(scripts) I've been watching recently. Usually, when I'm programming I like to have some background noise. I feel like having background noise can help me focus better especially in the current situation being at home and having distractions left and right. So when I want to minimize the distractions or noise at home, I just play some music or have a movie playing in the background while I do my school work. The songs in the file are called "Black Wave", "Helena Beat", "Warpaint", "Sick too", "Black out", and "Let's grove". The movie text that I've included is parts of the script from movies such as "Ready Player One", "John Wick Chapter 2", and "Halloween(2018)". This is some of the stuff I play in the background when programming so that's why I picked this text for my program. All the scripts where taken from subslikescript.com.
